__pathod__ is a collection of pathological tools for testing and torturing HTTP
clients and servers. The project has three components:

- __pathod__, an pathological HTTP daemon.
- __pathoc__, a perverse HTTP client. 
- __libpathod.test__, an API for easily using __pathod__ and __pathoc__ in unit tests.

dependencies is dead simple:
    
    pip install pathod

The project uses the __nose__ unit testing framework, which you can get here:
