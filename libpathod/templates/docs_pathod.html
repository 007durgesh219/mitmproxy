        <small>A pathological web daemon.</small>
    </h1>
</div>

<p>Pathod is a pathological HTTP daemon, designed to let you craft arbitrarily
malevolent HTTP responses. It lets you thoroughly exercise the failure modes of
HTTP clients by creatively violating the standards. HTTP responses are
specified using a <a href="/docs/language">small, terse language</a>, which
pathod shares with its evil twin pathoc. </p>


<section id="api">
    <div class="page-header">
       <h1>Getting started</h1>
    </div>

<p> To start playing with pathod, simply fire up the daemon: </p>

<pre class="terminal">./pathod</pre>

<p>By default, the service listens on port 9999 of localhost. Pathod's
documentation is self-hosting, and the pathod daemon exposes an interface that
lets you play with the specifciation language, preview what responses and
requests would look like on the wire, and view internal logs. To access all of
this, just fire up your browser, and point it to the following URL:</p>

<pre class="example">http://localhost:9999</pre>

<p>The default crafting anchor point is the path <b>/p/</b>. Anything after
this URL prefix is treated as a response specifier. Hitting the following URL
will generate an HTTP 200 response with 100 bytes of random data:</p>

<pre class="example">http://localhost:9999/p/200:b@100</pre>

<p>See the <a href="/docs/language">language documentation</a> to get (much)
fancier. The pathod daemon also takes a number of configuration options. To
view those, use the command-line help:</p>

<pre class="terminal">./pathod --help</pre>

<section id="api">
    <div class="page-header">
       <h1>Anchors</h1>
    </div>

You can also add anchors to the pathod server that serve a fixed response
whenever a matching URL is requested:</p>

<pre class="terminal">./pathod -a "/foo=200"</pre>

<p>Here, "/foo" a regex specifying the anchor path, and the part after the "=" is
a response specifier.</p>

<section>
    <div class="page-header">
       <h1>Internal Error Responses</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Pathod uses the non-standard 800 response code to indicate internal
    errors, to distinguish them from crafted responses. For example, a request
    to:</p>

    <pre class="example">http://localhost:9999/p/foo</pre>

    <p>... will return an 800 response because "foo" is not a valid page
    specifier.</p>

<section id="api">
    <div class="page-header">
       <h1>API</h1>
    </div>

    <p>pathod exposes a simple API, intended to make it possible to drive and
    inspect the daemon remotely for use in unit testing and the like. </p>


    <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tbody >
            <tr>
                <td>
                    /api/clear_log
                </td>
                <td>
                    A POST to this URL clears the log buffer.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    /api/info
                </td>
                <td>
                    Basic version and configuration info.

            <tr>
                <td>
                    /api/log
                </td>
                <td>
                    Returns the current log buffer. At the moment the buffer size is 500 entries -
                    when the log grows larger than this, older entries are discarded. The returned
                    data is a JSON dictionary, with the form:

                    <pre>{ 'log': [ ENTRIES ] } </pre>

                    You can preview the JSON data returned for a log entry through the built-in web
                    interface.
