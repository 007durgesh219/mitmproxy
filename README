mitmproxy is an interactive SSL-capable intercepting HTTP proxy. It lets you to
observe, modify and replay requests and responses on the fly. The underlying
library that mitmproxy is built on can also be used to do these things
programmatically. 

By default, mitmproxy starts up with a mutt-like interactive curses interface -
the help page (which you can view by pressing "?") should tell you everything
you need to know. Note that requests and responses are stored in-memory until
you delete them, so leaving mitmproxy running indefinitely or requesting very
large amounts of data through it is a bad idea.

mitmproxy intercepts SSL requests by simply assuming that all CONNECT requests
are https. The connection from the browser is wrapped in SSL, and we read the
request by pretending to be the connecting server. We then open an SSL request
to the destination server, and replay the request.

Requirements
------------

* The curses interface relies on a current version of the
[urwid](http://excess.org/urwid/) library.
* The test suite uses the [pry](http://github.com/cortesi/pry) unit testing
  library.

You should also make sure that your console environment is set up with the
following: 
    
* EDITOR environment variable to determine the external editor.
* PAGER environment variable to determine the external pager.
* Appropriate entries in your mailcap files to determine external
  viewers for request and response contents.
