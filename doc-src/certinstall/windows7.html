The Windows certificate manager expects a different certificate format from the
one used by mitmproxy. The easiest way to convert the cert to the appropriate
format is to use the Firefox web browser.


### 1: Make sure Firefox is installed on the system.

### 2: Fire up mitmproxy on the interception host. 

### 3: Configure Firefox to use the mitmproxy interceptor.

### 4: Using Firefox, browse to an SSL-protected domain. You will see a warning: 


### 5: Click "I understand the risks" and "Add Exception":


### 6: Click "Get certificate", "View", and switch to the "Details" tab:


### 7: Click "Export", and save the certificate in "X.509 Certificate (PEM)" format:


### 8: Next, start a command prompt, and type "certmgr" to start the Certificate Manager:


### 9: From the top menu, select "Action", "All tasks", and then "Import":


### 10: Click "Next", and browse to select the cert we just exported from Firefox:


### 11: Click "Next", and "Finish" to complete the import. Accept all warning prompts.
