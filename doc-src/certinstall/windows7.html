<p> Here's a quick and easy procedure you can use for Windows 7, as long as
the app in question uses the global Windows certificate repository. </p>

<ul>

    <li> Fire up MITMProxy, and configure Firefox on the Windows box to use
    it. Browse to the target domain, and you should see a big warning about
    an untrusted certificate. Use Firefox to export the certificate ("Add
    Exception", "Get Certificate", then "View", tab to "Details" and click
    "Export").  </li>

    <li> From the command console, fire up <b>certmgr</b>. Select "Trusted
    Root Certification Authorities", then on the top menu, "Action", "All
    Tasks", and "Import". When prompted, select the certificate file you've
    just saved from Firefox.</li>

    <li> And that's it - your certificate should now be trusted for that
    domain. Happy pentesting.</li>

</ul>
