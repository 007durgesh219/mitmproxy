## Installing from source

The preferred way to install mitmproxy - whether you're installing the latest release or from source - is to use [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/). If you don't already have pip on your system, you can find installation instructions [here](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).

If you are looking for a more information on how to install mitmproxy directly from the master branch on GitHub, or are wanting to set up mitmproxy for developement purposes, see the <a href="https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/README.mkd#hacking">Hacking</a> section of the README on GitHub. 

<pre class="terminal">
$ sudo pip install mitmproxy
</pre>

If you also want to install the optional packages AMF, protobuf and CSS
content views, do this:

<pre class="terminal">
$ sudo pip install "mitmproxy[contentviews]"
</pre>


## OSX

The easiest way to get up and running on OSX is to download the pre-built
binary packages from [mitmproxy.org](http://mitmproxy.org). If you still want
to install using pip, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- If you're running a Python interpreter installed with homebrew (or similar),
you may have to install some dependencies by hand. 
- Make sure that XCode is installed from the App Store, and that the
command-line tools have been downloaded (XCode/Preferences/Downloads).

There are a few bits of customization you might want to do to make mitmproxy
comfortable to use on OSX. The default color scheme is optimized for a dark
background terminal, but you can select a palette for a light terminal
background with the --palette option. You can use the OSX <b>open</b> program
to create a simple and effective <b>~/.mailcap</b> file to view request and
response bodies:

<pre class="terminal">
application/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
audio/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
image/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
video/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
</pre>


## Ubuntu

Ubuntu comes with Python but we need to install pip, python-dev and several libraries.  This was tested on a fully patched installation of Ubuntu 14.04.

<pre class="terminal">
$ sudo apt-get python-pip python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

$ sudo pip install mitmproxy
</pre>


## Windows

mitmweb and mitmdump are the only parts of mitmproxy that work on Windows.

Install the latest version of Python 2 from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Python website</a>.  The Windows MSI installer is fairly straight forward and even includes pip as long as you are installing a version of Python 2 after 2.7.9.  One option you should change during installation is "Add python.exe to Path".  This will make it easier to run Python.

Now log out of Windows and back in to finish having Python added to your PATH.

<pre class="terminal">
C:\> pip install mitmproxy
</pre>

From that point you just run mitmweb or mitmdump from the Command Prompt
 
<pre class="terminal">
C:\> mitmweb
</pre>
or
<pre class="terminal">
C:\> mitmdump
</pre>
