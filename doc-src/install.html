## <a id=docSource></a>Installing From Source

You can install mitmproxy with pip:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pip install mitmproxy
</pre>

If you also want to install the optional packages AMF, protobuf and CSS
content views, do this:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pip install "mitmproxy[contentviews]"
</pre>

If you are looking for a more information on how to install mitmproxy directly from the master branch on GitHub, or are wanting to set up mitmproxy for developement purposes, see the <a href="https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/README.mkd#hacking">Hacking</a> section of the README on GitHub. 

## <a id=docOSX></a>Installation On Mac OS X

The easiest way to get up and running on OSX is to download the pre-built binary packages from [mitmproxy.org](http://mitmproxy.org). If you still want to install using pip, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- If you're running a Python interpreter installed with homebrew (or similar), you may have to install some dependencies by hand. 
- Make sure that XCode is installed from the App Store, and that the command-line tools have been downloaded (XCode/Preferences/Downloads).

There are a few bits of customization you might want to do to make mitmproxy comfortable to use on OSX. The default color scheme is optimized for a dark background terminal, but you can select a palette for a light terminal background with the --palette option. You can use the OSX <b>open</b> program to create a simple and effective <b>~/.mailcap</b> file to view request and response bodies:

<pre class="terminal">
application/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
audio/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
image/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
video/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
</pre>

From now on you can run <a href="mitmproxy.html">mitmproxy</a> or <a href="mitmdump.html">mitmdump</a> from a terminal.

## <a id=docUbuntu></a>Installation On Ubuntu

Ubuntu comes with Python but we need to install pip, python-dev and several libraries.  This was tested on a fully patched installation of Ubuntu 14.04.

<pre class="terminal">
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

$ sudo pip install mitmproxy
</pre>

From now on you can run <a href="mitmproxy.html">mitmproxy</a> or <a href="mitmdump.html">mitmdump</a> from a terminal.

## <a id=docWindows></a>Installation On Windows

Please note that mitmdump is the only component of mitmproxy that is supported on Windows.

Install the latest version of Python 2 from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Python website</a>.  The Windows MSI installer is fairly straightforward and even includes pip as long as you are installing a version of Python 2 after 2.7.9.  For the most part, you can accept the defaults but one option you should change during installation is "Add python.exe to Path".  This will make it easier to run Python.

Now log out of Windows and back in to finish having Python added to your PATH.

<pre class="terminal">
C:\> pip install mitmproxy
</pre>

From now on you can run <a href="mitmdump.html">mitmdump</a> from a Command Prompt.
