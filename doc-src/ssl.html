SSL
===

The first time __mitmproxy__ or __mitmdump__ is started, a dummy SSL
certificate authority is generated (the default location is
~/.mitmproxy/ca.pem). This dummy CA is used to generate dummy certificates for
SSL interception on-the-fly. Since your browser won't trust the __mitmproxy__
dummy CA out of the box (and rightly so), so you will see an SSL cert warning
every time you visit a new SSL domain through __mitmproxy__. When you're
testing a single site, just accepting the bogus SSL cert manually is not too
much of a hassle, but there are a number of cases where you will want to
configure your testing system or browser to trust __mitmproxy__:

- If you are testing non-browser software that checks SSL cert validiy.
- You are testing an app that makes non-interactive (JSONP, script src, etc.)
requests to SSL resources. Another workaround in this case is to manually visit
the page through the browser, and add a certificate exception.
- You just don't want to deal with the hassle of continuously adding cert
exceptions.
