- Looking at the connection list, we can see that we visited __gmail.com__,
which then returned a 301 redirect.
- The statusbar tells us that there are 11 flows in the list, and that we're
currently using the "pretty" view mode.
- Also visible is the __Event log__, which can be toggled on and off with the
__v__ keyboard shortcut. This displays events like client connection
information, errors, and script output.
