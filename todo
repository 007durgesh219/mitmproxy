This is a loose collection of todo items, in case someone else wants to start
hacking on mitmproxy. Drop me a line (aldo@corte.si) if you want to tackle any
of these and need some pointers.

Features:

    - Support for content encodings. At the moment, we sidestep this by
    stripping headers that indicate accepted encodings. In theory, this should
    force servers to serve us content uncompressed, but that's not always the
    case. Besides, we should try to modify requests as little as possible, so
    direct support for deflate and gzip is the way to go.
    - Add some "workspace" features to mitmproxy:
        - Flow comments
        - Copying/duplicating flows
        - Ordering by time, size, etc. a-la-mutt (o keyboard shorcut is reserved for this)
    - Post and URL field parsing and editing.
        - We need a built-in graphical editor for these, that knows how to
        break fields up and present them for modificatio individually.
    - No-proxy mode, for when we want to just replay without serving as a proxy ourselves.
    - Upstream proxy support.
    - Strings view for binary responses.
    - Chunked encoding support for requests (we already support it for responses).
    - Better manipulation of flows in mitmproxy: copying flows, adding
    comments.

Bugs:
    
    - In some circumstances, long URLs in list view are line-broken oddly.
    - When a bug in mitmproxy causes a stack trace, we hang on exit.
