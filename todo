Future:

    - Strings view.
    - Field parsing and editing.
    - On-the-fly generation of keys, signed with a CA
    - Pass-through fast-track for things that don't match filter?
    - Reading contents from file
    - Saving contents to file
    - Shortcut for viewing in pager
    - Serializing and de-serializing requests and responses.
    - Use real non-blocking input handling to minimize cpu load.
    - Give the ability to beep on certain events. (On intercepted
      request/response already working.)


Bugs:
    
    - In some circumstances, long URLs in list view are line-broken oddly.
    - Termination sometimes hangs.
